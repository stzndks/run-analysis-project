Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository is for the submission of Getting and Cleaning Data week 4 course project.

Files

a. "CodeBook.md"" a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data

b. "run_analysis.R"" performs the data tidy preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course project assignment:
1. merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. from the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
There is an additional step to the script which test the resulted output

c. Finaltidydata.txt is the final data file after going through all the above steps.
